        <ol>
            <li>Cook tomato on a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until slightly blackened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool until easily handled. Peel off skin and remove seeds.</li>
            <li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add <i>guajillo</i> and <i>ancho</i> chile peppers; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine tomato flesh, softened chile peppers, 2 slices pineapple, orange juice, quartered onion, vinegar, chipotle peppers, salt, garlic, cloves, cumin seeds, and oregano in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Arrange pork slices in a glass or ceramic baking dish. Pour blended mixture over pork, ensuring all sides are evenly coated. Cover baking dish with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Marinate pork in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Cook remaining pineapple slices on a ridged grill pan over medium-high heat until slightly blackened and soft, about 5 minutes per side. Chop into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Wipe out grill pan and preheat over medium-high heat. Cook marinated pork in the hot pan, turning once, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
