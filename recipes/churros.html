        <img src="../img/churro.webp">
        <h2>This is a typical spanish breakfast that is usually combined with hot chocolate or sugar.</h2>
        <p>This is a really easy and delicious meal that is most common in the southern part of the country, since it's one of the most loved breakfast of so many people although not the healthiest one.</p>
        <p>It sometimes is also taken during a break while people work. Sometimes also it's paired with hot chocolate or a bunch of sugar to improve its flavour.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
            <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
        </ol>
